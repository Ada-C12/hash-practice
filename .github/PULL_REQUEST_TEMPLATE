## Comprehension Questions

Question | Answer
:------------- | :-------------
1. Why is a good Hash Function Important? | To provide a time complexity of O(1) for insert, delete and search|

2. How can you judge if a hash function is good or not? | A good hash function has the following attributes:
- Fast computation of the hash value 
- Hash values are uniformly distributed
- Keys that are close have hash values that are far apart
- Hashing appears to be random (hard to deduce the original object â€“ this is why hashing is also used in cryptography)|

3. Is there a perfect hash function?  If so what is it? |Yes, A hash function for which there are no collisions is called a "perfect hash function"|

4. Describe a strategy to handle collisions in a hash table | Separate Chaining: uses a linked list to store the collided keys|

5. Describe a situation where a hash table wouldn't be as useful as a binary search tree | Hash tables are not good for finding ordered data. Linked list and binary search tree can get us the min and max in O(n) and O(log n) time.|

6. What is one thing that is more clear to you on hash tables now | I learned the ways to handle collisions in a hash table. Need more practice|
